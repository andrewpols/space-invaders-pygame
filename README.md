# Space Invaders

## Background
- This program recreates the iconic Space Invaders game using Python and [Pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame).
- Using [Pygbag](https://github.com/pygame-web/pygbag), a Python WebAssembly package, this code is available on non-local servers (it is ran through the index.html and apk file shown in the root directory).
- The source code can be found in the src folder in the root directory (Note: The index.html file in the root directory is NOT part of the original souce codeâ€”it is built through Pygbag).

## Aim of the Game
- Starting with 3 lives, survive and kill all aliens!
- Each alien awards 100 points, while every hit taken from an alien loses a life.
- A bonus alien will periodically fly at the top of the screen. Hit it for extra points and an extra heart.
- Once you're done, play again.

## Controls
- Move Left/Right: L/R Arrow Keys
