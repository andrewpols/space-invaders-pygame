## Background
- This program recreates the iconic Space Invaders game using Python and [Pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame).
- Using [Pygbag](https://github.com/pygame-web/pygbag), a Python WebAssembly package, this code is available on non-local servers (it is ran through the index.html and apk file shown in the root directory).
- The source code can be found in the src folder in the root directory (Note: The index.html file in the root directory is NOT part of the original souce code—it is built through Pygbag).
- **Play now via [GitHub Pages](https://andrewpols.github.io/space-invaders-pygame/)**
